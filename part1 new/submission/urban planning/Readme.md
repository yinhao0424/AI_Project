## Part 2. Urban planning
***Needed packages:*** copy, math, numpy, random, timeit

- You can run ‘urban_planing.py’ in terminal with two parameters, ***filename and algorithm. ***
- For algorithm, HC represents  hill climbing with restart and simulated annealing, GA represents genetic algorithm.
- ***Ex: python3 urban_planning.py 'urban 1.txt' HC***

The output will be a file, containing the score for the best map, time that first achieved best score, the best map. The best map will also show in the terminal as well.
